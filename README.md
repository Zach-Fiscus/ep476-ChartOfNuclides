# ep476-ChartOfNuclides

Shared repository for collaborative development of Chart of Nuclides data

This respository will be used to introduce collaborative development via
Github to a group of (mostly) nuclear engineering students during an in-class exercise.

For each element in the periodic table, there will be a new directory named
`SS-NN`, where `SS` represents the 1 or 2 character chemical symbol and `NN`
represents the atomic number.

Within each element directory, there will be a directory for each isotope named `AAA`,
where `AAA` is the mass number for that isotope.

Within each isotope directory, there will be files that contain additional
information, but at least one called `name_en.txt` that contains the full
English name for the element.

Additional files may be added, as chosen/identified collaboratively by the
contributors.  The list of possible files should be kept up to date here:

* `name_en.txt` : full name of element in English
